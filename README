What:
This Makefile setup extracts JDK directories from Oracle JDK dmg files.
It also acts as a reference for the extraction process.

Why:
Whereas Oracle provides simple archives for other platforms,
they provide JDKs for macOS packaged in dmg files with pkg installers.
Unfortunately, these installers do not let the user choose where the JDK is installed on the system.
Extracting the JDK from the dmg file allows the user to choose where the JDK is installed without having to build from source.

How:
The procedure for extraction is basically...
1. Mount the dmg
2. Extract the pkg from inside the dmg
3. Copy the jdk from inside the extracted pkg

Prerequisites:
You must download the expected dmg files, and place them within this directory.
The dmg files for JDK 8 Update 181 and JDK 10.0.2 can be found at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
