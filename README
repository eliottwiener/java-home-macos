Oracle provides JDKs in dmg files for macOS.
These dmg files contain pkg installers.
Unfortunately, these installers do not let you choose where your JDK is installed.
The provided Makefile is set up to extract JAVA_HOME-ready directories from the dmg files.

The procedure for doing this is basically:

1. Mount the dmg
2. Copy the pkg from inside the dmg
3. Extract the pkg
4. Copy the home directory from the extracted pkg

You must download the expected dmg files, and place them within this directory.
